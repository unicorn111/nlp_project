Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier\\'s plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have \"clairvoyance\". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it\\'s the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all...', 'label': 1}\n",

I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.<br /><br />Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I don't give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />\", 'label': 1}\n"

            "ruined potential. while yes it is great that we are getting a fnaf movie, it is a pretty damn wrong move that they based it off only one of the games. which is why they pretty much ran out of context and made the animatronics \"want to make the girl like them\" just imagine the whole mess of a lore and details explained through this, or just seeing it through a character's eyes like micheal or sum would just be much better. but i guess that would ruin the potential of other movies to come which also means more money. -adding on to this, you can see springtrap or william in the classic bonnie suit (most likely springtrap because the suit looks damaged but could be otherewise since hes carrying a knife) just in a split second at 2:08 which most likely means it is a teaser for further movies or just like a flashback of him killing the children\n",

            "not my vibe personally, tbh. feels like a noisy cheese fest for people with short attention spans rather than the ambient, unnerving horror feel that made the games actually creepy. don't mean to be that guy. lol explanation: i still don't dig the red glowing eyes when the tiny white pupils within the soulless black sockets are so much creepier. the roatating saw blades within the endoskeletons' faces scream \"evil robot\" more than it screams \"possessed animatronic.\" adding two other characters into the mix during the night shift sections of the movie eliminates the fear you had of being \"alone\" in the pizzaria with nothing but a voice-mail each night to keep you company. all the flashing lights and loud music (which may not happen super often during the movie, i get that) puts a wrench in the dark and silent atmosphere that made hearing any sounds, even the most subtle, make you wanna shit your pants out of paranoia. those are just to name a handful of things that bother me about the feel of the film, but that's not to say there's nothing that looks good. visually, it looks great! the animatronics' designs are respectful to the source material. the pizzaria feels authentic and creative. and i mean, come on, coryxkenshin is never not a win. i know a lot of people won't agree with my take, and that's cool. blumhouse seems to be having a lot of fun making this film, but it's not looking to be my personal cup of tea.\n",

            "i have a few.. opinions. it’s not looking to be a horror film. not even a thriller. from what it seems like, it’s like their trying to make it a slasher. and coming from a slasher fanatic who loves shit like friday the 13th and scream, this but coming from fnaf, that’s not what me or the fan base imo is looking for. secondly, the practical effect effects. i’m sorry but the animatronics look terrible. not in costume but in acting and play. they turn and act as if someone was working in a scare house or an escape room and they act like they’re in the suit. isn’t the whole point of the story to have it to where the spirits are controlling the suits? in this, it really doesn’t feel like the acting from in the suits are doing well, more so appearing as if the actors are pantomiming robots. that doesn’t mean i won’t go and watch the movie. i was 11 when this series started and i’ll be 19 when this movie comes out but i can’t treat it like some movie where i just turn my brain off and enjoy. i’ll be judging because i grew up with this franchise like many others. i just hope they won’t fuck it up. however, the best part of this trailer? coryxkenshin baby! wooooo\n",

            "\"kalosmi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\" - lord krishna, bhagavad gita chapter 11 verse 22 direct translation (grammatically weird since it is across two time dimensions - one that of arjuna/humans (i.e the one we are in, or what we think of as time) and the other one eternal that krishna is from, which is transcendental and outside of the multiverse (that contains many universes such as ours)): \"[now] i have (/am) become death (/time), the destroyer of worlds\". the reason for the two tenses is because from arjuna's perspective, kala manifests as death in a linear progression across his timeline, whereas in krishna's cosmic perspective, kala is eternal time (since universal consciousness has no birth or death, and krishna is referred to as the supreme anthropomorphic personality of godhead, the only swayambhoo avatar of vishnu), which always existed, exists, and will exist. it is like arjuna is speaking in our normal forward progression of time, but krishna is speaking from outside human time, like from an einsteinian 4d spacetime. that is why kala means both death and time in sanskrit. it is hard to properly translate to english unless you can bring in the concept of dual time dimensions as in the gita (as well as general relativity- where past, present and future coexist as a pseudo-riemannian manifold). the way i think of it is like this- suppose npcs in a 3d game were conscious agents, and i as the real human player can interact with the npcs. i have a time dimension that is different from the time dimension npcs live in. if the game were like a prescripted movie, and the time for npc to die has come, it is death for them, but time for me. and in their world, i have become death. depending on perspective of the subject the verse can be read in one of two ways: \"now i have become death, the destroyer of worlds\" or \"i am time, the destroyer of worlds\" it is very important to note here that krishna says this verse not as himself but as swayambhoo vishnu, the transcendental vishwaroopa form that he takes on to impress arjuna before making this statement. oppenheimer's expertise in nuclear physics was paralleled also by his expertise in sanskrit. a true polymath genius.\n",

(where we are now. remember what someone said about world war 4. paraphrased, \"i know not what weapons ww3 will be fought with.\" well, now we know. \"but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones.\" so what's the solution in an ever-escalating age of detail and agenda? mises and art laffer. chris nolan, mises and art laffer. should have countered the joker with that. instead of ignoring them. \"but if not.\" chris nolan. \"but if not.\" there but for the grace of [nothing?] go i? what an omission that was. well, we should have listened to ben stein all along, ferris bueller should have suffered the statists and remained in high school a bit longer in the 1980's. he didn't. so the best we got was star trek 7 and a false death that nobody cared for. \"bridge on the captain\" bill shatner wanted to joke. well, it's been fun. no the church and the bible are not dead, someone please tell nietzsche, the darwinian posthumanists, the socialists, and the greeks that reality is not lost. so, before the liberal documentary \"waiting for superman\" revealed the overly-inflated self-importance of our ineffective regime school systems, there was ben stein's 2007 \"expelled: no intelligence allowed\" exposing the king of the new atheists, richard dawkins. he didn't like what ben stein caught on tape. punctuated equilibrium, the excuse for lack of evidence, becomes panspermia. richard dawkins actually stated that e.t. very well could have done it. (it, being the original intelligent design of all biologies.) but at the same time he conclusively rejected another hypothesis. it was definitely *not* an eternal metaphysical designer from beyond the time-paradox of infinite regress. that's impossible. allegedly. we must have untraceable, imaginary infinite regression instead, as indicated by dawkins. or you could heed ben stein's critique - and allow it in the discourses, the politics, and the classrooms. you choose, right? how can you choose if you can't talk about it? or we can simply proclaim the doom of all that is, like marx declared pre-communist manifesto: \"everything that exists deserves to die.\" well, i would assert that is not exactly true: because eternal things exist and act with awareness - or where did ours first arise from? accident? the complexity and regular predictability of designs (both tangible and intangible) speaks otherwise - of a designed tangible and intangible within one shared universe. and such must have had an even greater designer. or it all arose by accidental chance. (does such accidental chance resemble the universe as scientists now perceive it in 2023 with all cutting edge instruments? no. the answer to such a hypothesis of things arising from non-life to life by chance is: no. so we therefore must assert that the positive reality is indeed a metaphysical one - and that the human individual is foundationally metaphysical in nature. and to the point: no, i am not a trinitarian, but i do believe the bible.) \"but if not.\" what is the historical significance of that phrase that helped avoid certain doom in the 1940's? someone should ask chris nolan, since \"everyone\" seems to think he's so brilliant at theater. war is real. nolan needs to up his games - or he is simply fighting & contending for the wrong team (that of evil and nazi-ism, to be frank - and that is not the side of the righteous among the nations). take my word for it.

            "sometimes i feel that marketing will be the death of art and historical fact on film... this film seems completely overhyped especially considering that nearly the whole story of the manhattan project is in this trailer and is a story that has been told a dozen times already and in some cases very well... with this trailer making it seem almost like a rip-off of some of those earlier endeavors to tell the story in particular with nothing seeming very knew about this attempt and therefore an almost pointless exercise if it wasn't for the immense historical weight and importance of these events. it is not missed on me that it is a nolan film and therefore likely to be at least semi decent and possibly of a scale that will look really good in imax though i'm not so sure the story itself will really benefit from imax. there isn't a lot of action pieces or a large-scale image to tell except for the test explosions themselves and of course sadly the final horrific results in hiroshima and nagasaki. the acting in the trailer seems very stiff with matt damon in particular not coming across very well here to the point of feeling miscast. it also does seem by far not enough of a cautionary tale that it should be, at least as how portrayed in this trailer. it should be about the most cautionary tale that could be told, but this really feels like american propaganda at its best. again the hype and self-aggrandizement that the trailers for this film has dripping from its every pore since the first teaser to this one does not bode well. with the film's self- titling i would imagine it is meant to be somewhat of a biographical treatise of the man oppenheimer himself but it's clear that it's really about the manhattan project more than anything else which i would say makes it predictable. heaven forbid they make a film about oppenheimer that doesn't purely focus on the manhattan project. it could be that it is actually a very good film but that the marketing department needs to be taken out back and made an example of, but we won't know until we see it and are $15 and more out-of-pocket and 3 plus hours of our time to prepare to go to see and then come back that we can never get back. nowadays i really feel like we should be able to try before we buy when it comes to hollywood films. i am not holding my breath. is it just me or does this almost feel like desperate marketing? the only thing it doesn't do is say in the classic style with an ominous booming voice,\" this summer, one man, given an impossible task that will change everything but save the world and plunge it into chaos...\" in reality we know that the manhattan project was certainly not about one man, but about tens of thousands of people and the resources of an entire country and then some along with many collateral deaths and long-term suffering aside from the actual immediate victims themselves in japan. historically speaking of course a huge slap was needed to stop the misguided leaders at the time in japan in its tracks, but i'd really like to see an epic story that told the hole unvarnished truth warts-and-all. one thing i always wondered about is why the united states didn't just explode a few of these early nuclear weapons off the coast or strictly military targets away from civilian population centers. certainly it would have been nearly as effective and bring about the end of wwii in the pacific. just something to think about. remember that pearl harbor( another gilded hollywood production almost akin to a little bit of propaganda) was largely military casualties and the pentagon and washington had had some warnings that it was to come. of course i'm looking at this with the hind side of history. anyway when it comes to telling this story again... i'll just sit here and hope that we're getting a less sugar-coated version of history here but if that's the case that's not what this trailer is saying and does not make me want to go see it. i know i may seem to have a controversial opinion especially when talking about just a movie trailer but when you're talking about something like the manhattan project and oppenheimer or anything to do with world war ii, i don't see how you can't have a controversial opinion. out of respect for everybody that died and the collateral damage that we still feel to this day literally across the planet, that the only thing to tell is the actual truth.\n",
