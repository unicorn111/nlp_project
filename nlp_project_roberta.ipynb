Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier\\'s plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have \"clairvoyance\". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it\\'s the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all...', 'label': 1}\n",

I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.<br /><br />Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I don't give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />\", 'label': 1}\n"

[bonnie] (spoken) oops, sorry. (mark screams) [bonnie] what's that sound? [chica] seems to be screaming. [freddy] everything's seeming slightly strange. [bonnie] let's say \"hi.\" he seems a bit jumpy [mark] how do these cameras change?! they're heading here just to eat me like juicy flesh fruit or maybe they'll all stuff me inside a fazbear suit! seal the doors! hit the lights! [freddy] hey new guy are you alright? [mark] stay away! leave me be! [freddy] don't be scared; it's only me [chica] (spoken) maybe we should leave him a note (instrumental pause) [chica] (spoken) oh no, he sounds like he's in trouble (sung) foxy, are you there? the new guy's trapped inside [mark] they're breaking down the door! [chica] he sounds so terrified [freddy] hold on, foxy's come to get you [mark] is that something in the vent? why's it smell like blood and mucus? [bonnie] that's our natural scent [freddy] hey!

            "my theory for the movie: so it starts off with the old man not being william. it does suck, but if you didn’t notice, springtrap was in the trailer, so it makes sense why he isn’t. so that means that william was done rotting, and it was confirmed that freddy fazbear entertainment has reached their peak in the 80’s. the children went missing already, stayed by the trailer, but how would the “owners keep holding on to the franchise?” because in fnaf 1 the company was going bankrupt as seen in the easter egg newspapers. maybe the owners were what was left of fazbear entertainment (henry, etc,) and being the company now as “fazbear freights.” also, the animictronics we’re going after mike’s daughter, apparently. this may lead to the theory of golden freddy being 2 kids, a boy and a girl. mike’s daughter could be the girl, and from the fnaf 2 mini game “give life” it showed that golden freddy still existed, so maybe during fnaf 2 golden freddy was made with the boy, but then how would the girl be stuffed into golden freddy, being part spiritual and physical and having space in the spirit of golden freddy for 2 souls? decisions, decisions… also the movie is gonna be a banger. updated! the boy could be in the physical form of golden freddy, showing how he attacks the night guards even as an illusion. and the girl could be the spirit, where in ultimate custom night shows golden freddy shaking, leading to where old man consequences told the vengeful spirit to let go of william, maybe having the girl forgiving william as well, so the rest of golden freddy won’t lash out at william as he goes. another update golden freddy has one eye showing he isn’t full yet, so that is why he was friendly to the girl, he probably wanted her to feel comfortable in her last minutes before conjoining into one entity\n",

(where we are now. remember what someone said about world war 4. paraphrased, \"i know not what weapons ww3 will be fought with.\" well, now we know. \"but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones.\" so what's the solution in an ever-escalating age of detail and agenda? mises and art laffer. chris nolan, mises and art laffer. should have countered the joker with that. instead of ignoring them. \"but if not.\" chris nolan. \"but if not.\" there but for the grace of [nothing?] go i? what an omission that was. well, we should have listened to ben stein all along, ferris bueller should have suffered the statists and remained in high school a bit longer in the 1980's. he didn't. so the best we got was star trek 7 and a false death that nobody cared for. \"bridge on the captain\" bill shatner wanted to joke. well, it's been fun. no the church and the bible are not dead, someone please tell nietzsche, the darwinian posthumanists, the socialists, and the greeks that reality is not lost. so, before the liberal documentary \"waiting for superman\" revealed the overly-inflated self-importance of our ineffective regime school systems, there was ben stein's 2007 \"expelled: no intelligence allowed\" exposing the king of the new atheists, richard dawkins. he didn't like what ben stein caught on tape. punctuated equilibrium, the excuse for lack of evidence, becomes panspermia. richard dawkins actually stated that e.t. very well could have done it. (it, being the original intelligent design of all biologies.) but at the same time he conclusively rejected another hypothesis. it was definitely *not* an eternal metaphysical designer from beyond the time-paradox of infinite regress. that's impossible. allegedly. we must have untraceable, imaginary infinite regression instead, as indicated by dawkins. or you could heed ben stein's critique - and allow it in the discourses, the politics, and the classrooms. you choose, right? how can you choose if you can't talk about it? or we can simply proclaim the doom of all that is, like marx declared pre-communist manifesto: \"everything that exists deserves to die.\" well, i would assert that is not exactly true: because eternal things exist and act with awareness - or where did ours first arise from? accident? the complexity and regular predictability of designs (both tangible and intangible) speaks otherwise - of a designed tangible and intangible within one shared universe. and such must have had an even greater designer. or it all arose by accidental chance. (does such accidental chance resemble the universe as scientists now perceive it in 2023 with all cutting edge instruments? no. the answer to such a hypothesis of things arising from non-life to life by chance is: no. so we therefore must assert that the positive reality is indeed a metaphysical one - and that the human individual is foundationally metaphysical in nature. and to the point: no, i am not a trinitarian, but i do believe the bible.) \"but if not.\" what is the historical significance of that phrase that helped avoid certain doom in the 1940's? someone should ask chris nolan, since \"everyone\" seems to think he's so brilliant at theater. war is real. nolan needs to up his games - or he is simply fighting & contending for the wrong team (that of evil and nazi-ism, to be frank - and that is not the side of the righteous among the nations). take my word for it.
