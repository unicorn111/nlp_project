Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier\\'s plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have \"clairvoyance\". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it\\'s the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all...', 'label': 1}\n",

I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.<br /><br />Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I don't give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />\", 'label': 1}\n"

            "who here thinks that the officer is actually vanessa?\n",
            "it is tough to tell 100% from the trailer, but it looks like freddy and the gang are going to be cgi. i understand its cheaper, but that is a huge missed opportunity and will take away from the horror. practical effects would have been leaps and bounds better for this in particular.\n",
            "holy fuck\n",
            "so its not canon.\n",
            "why did they show spring trip so early he’s supposed to be in fnaf three\n",

            "fnaffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n",
            "so does this mean that this set after the deaths of the children and the bite? so give me a reason they need a night guard!? and this would be seperate from what we already know in fnaf lore as i’m assuming that is spring trap in the bunny suit with white eyes? or golden bonnie? man i have so many questions for how it all fits into the previous games and books.\n",
            "i fucking need markiplier to be in the movie!!!\n",

            "looks like trash, again\n",
            "this is kinda inaccurate as the animatronics wanted to protect the kids also i would have liked for scott to voice phone guy like fnaf.\n",

            "ohhh bud got springlocked\n",
            "never understood what was so scary? one of the most overrated “horror” games. youtubers must of been paid to act that scared when the game first released. sure it’s scary to kids but adults haha it’s not scary\n",
            "this is super cliché, i don't have high hopes for this movie\n",
            "we wait 9 years. aaaaaaaaa\n",
            "that ending kinda looks like the security guard is going to be golden freddy or smth\n",

            "would be funny if the cop's name was vanessa\n",
            "stop chewing so frickin loud bruh\n",
            "don’t get me wrong here, im still super stoked for this movie and really proud of scott for taking a small indie game this far, but those druggie looking yellow eyes are still terrible. wish they’d use the blacked out sockets with the single white dot in the center\n",
            "that looks kinda bad… it started off good, but that kid actor looks like she’ll bring the movie down… and that expedition dump character… a good writer and some decent money could have built the script up with the environment and the actually interesting thing the robots… they look too clean and the spirit thing should have been a reveal not the selling point of the movie… that’s going to kill a kinda unique and interesting idea for casual audiences.\n",
            "i swear the living tombstone better create the soundtrack for this movie\n",
            "the red eyes are fucking awful bro, change it bro\n",
            "if matpat isn’t a detective in this movie i’m not leaving happy\n",
            "this movie is gonna be trash without markiplier in it\n",
            "was that spring trap?\n",

            "0:17 wonder why they did that mister afton\n",
            "meh…reminds me of a bad version of the nicolas cage movie willy’s wonderland. probably will skip this because it’s a rip off and meg was awful.\n",
            "alright, if there’s springtrap then that guy who’s answering the phone call is not william afton\n",
            "holy fazbear, i'm already theorizing on the plot...\n",
            "springtrap 2:08 appearing in the very first movie is a red flag that this story will be rushed. the random kid in the movie is another red flag that this movie will not follow the story and may pull a \"transformers\" by including random protagonist\n",
            "noooo there is no the living tombstone song\n",
            "ever since security breach crashed and burned, i dont have much hope for any future fnaf projects. in my humble opinion, i think this shouldve ended a long time ago. because the direction this franchise is headed doesnt seem very bright and the plot was already extremely convoluted before but hey, maybe itll be good. im not going to raise my hopes too much, i just hope they at least capture some of the horror from the original, because thats what made fnaf, fnaf. i hope its at least kind of dark, and yknow. actually scary. thats literally all i want from this lol.\n",
            "bruh, no way my man corey is the cab driver lol\n",
            "ok but whos abby?? is she supposed to be elizabeth?\n",
            "nah, there's no way they used the frederick fitzgerald fazbear song at 1:09\n",
            "fucking cory kenshin is here? now i'm whatching it\n",
            "lol, the first trailer was number one trending in movies for about two weeks, it even hit trending then one piece came out and took number one, then blumhouse and universal pictures really said, ohh hohohoho, let me nail shut your coffin. (this is a joke)\n",
            "if there is no springlock scene in this complete abomination of fnaf lore ima commit war crimes.\n",
            "cory is in here???? what!!!!\n",
            "all these comments read the same(series has come so far, cory, ect.) hinting that the comments are bought/fake; cgi always ruins horror movies(and this cgi looks bad); and they made a nod-to-freddys horror movie staring nick cage years ago called willy's wonderland.\n",
            "who came to this trailer to watch coryxkenshin. raise your hand\n",
            "man crazy how cory’s in the movie, but damn markiplier should’ve been in the movie\n",
            "are my eyes deceiving me or did i just see coryxfuckingkenshin???!!!\n",
            "1:46 freddy's eyes are green?! what could that mean!?\n",
            "this looks so goofy. i was hoping for a vibe like og fnaf 1 where its actually going to scare me using its atmosphere and the uncanny factor of the robots. not whatever goofy ah terminator reject this is.\n",
            "looks terrible but in a so terrible it’s funny way.\n",
            "i wasn't thinking it would be so good!\n",
            "ok guys, if fnaf got a movie, there is hope for an undertale movie.\n",
            "this movie will be intentionally confusing just see\n",
            "trailer spoils the ending.\n",
            "wonder by the end of this movie freddy and the security guard will be a team to take down golden freddy in the next movie\n",
            "i have never been so conflicted in my life. on one side this looks badass. but on the other hand they just threw shit in without even concidering the lore. like, why is michael just some dude, why is the freaking scooper there, why is springtrap there, and why in gods name do the gang want to \"make her like them\" that is not their mo at all, they just attacked because mike looks like his dad who apparently isnt his dad in this movie.\n",
            "is that the #15 meme man when the voice says \"keep your eyes on the monitor\"\n",
            "... just spoil the climax in the trailer? really? i expected seeing some big story beats, every trailer does that, but pulling a ruby gillman so soon after ruby gillman?\n",
            "didn't nicholas cage make this movie a few years ago?\n",
            "if markiplier isn’t in it i’m not watching it\n",
            "complete rip off of that nick cage film a few years back lol\n",
            "cory’s in this shir holy fuck lets goooooo\n",
            "i really hope mattpat makes a cameo in this movie or markiplier otherwise 0/10 movie\n",

            "matpat boutta be looking for lore in this movie\n",
            "aint no way, they put my bot cory in there! lets gooo!\n",
            "you just got freddy fazbeared\n",
            "this manages to look both better and worse than the nick cage bootleg. and that was a ridiculous b-movie :)\n",
            "i really hope they didn't turn this into a \"family friendly\" horror movie\n",
            "seems like unlike paramount pictures with the sonic movie, universal pictures aren't gonna fix the eyes problem\n",
            "2:16 i'm pogging so fucking hard right now lets fucking goooooooooooo\n",
            "i can see that we arnt gunna get the bite of 83, bite of 87 or springlock failure in this movie\n",
            "yo! we got cory devante williams! now where mark edward fischbach at?!\n",
            "cory?! no way.\n",
            "time to not take this movie seriously because it looks like they all smoked a fat joint\n",
            "who do you want to call? nicolas cage\n",
            "please tell me that steve raglan was just a fake name to cover has real identity....\n",
            "why do i gotta a feeling this movie is gonna flop\n",
            "lol this looks bad.\n",
            "oh dear god a child.\n",
            "please, delete this ugly red eyes! as fan of fnaf, i cannot watch it black eyes with white pount looks better and even better, when without eyes and not angry it's much scarier this way do better for the fans, and so, the movie looks\n",
            "imagine if they had casted markiplier for this\n",
            "am i the only one that feels insanely disconnected with this franchise? i dont like the games even though im a horror fan because its really childish and extremely boring. i still dont get how this took off the way it did. can someone explain the hype behind this? i seriously dont get it\n",
            "it looks cool but the plot looks kinda dumb\n",
            "my boy bonnie barley got on that guitar before he shut it off.\n",
            "im wondering if this movie is gonna be on any streaming services other than peacock o-o\n",
            "big titted goth foxy please.\n",
            "2:08 is that a spingtrap i see?\n",
            "cory the goat let\"s go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, i hope we see mark or matpat as a cameo but it most likely that mark won't have a cameo since he doing his own film but still in some form\n",
            "why can't i stop watching this\n",
            "this movie gonna be pure cringe\n",
            "disappointing fact: we won't get any phone guy calls reason: it's 2023 and not 1993\n",
            "something tells me it's gonna be bad. too many characters, too many lights, why did he come with a child? i think it will lack the atmosphere that the first game had.\n",
            "please review the animatronics they look unattractive\n",
            "no way coryxkenshin is in this movie\n",
            "crash bandicoot movie will be next. crash the party.\n",
            "man mark better be in thing shit\n",
            "looks like a sequel to willys wonderland with nic cage\n",
            "i feel bad for the security breach fans thinking this is going to be kid friendly but it’s the complete opposite and get the crap scared out of them\n",
            "is nobody talking about the split second we saw foxy maybe about to do the running thing in fnaf 1 1:47-1:48 slow motion it\n",

            "i cant understand the lore from this and who is who.\n",
            "so the animatronic is mike that we saw on the poster\n",
            "its like fuhnaff\n",
            "i don’t like how they went too much like an american show on this, making fun of the animatronics while there should more be a stressful vibe like a horror movie. the way they went on this doesn’t match the fnaf universe…\n",
            "they got cory in this yooo\n",
            "holy crap coryxkenshin's in here\n",
            "this movie is not canon\n",
            "i really hope it's not all cgi and some parts of the animatronics were puppeted to look really cool.\n",
            "lmaoo “why do i always get the weirdos\n",
            "this movie could be the worst movie ever made and yet id still watch it 100 times (it seems like its going to be the best one out)\n",
            "i swear to god this better be good or ima slit the writer's throat out\n",
            "2:05, who is that?\n",
            "this movie looks so bad im soo excited to watch\n",
            "we better see some meat in those costumes especially spring trap\n",
            "as cool as it is to see this movie still come to fruition. i avidly dislike the direction the story seems to be heading. revealing the missing children possessing the animatronics right in the trailer and at the start of the movie is not just a confusing decision but one that actively hurts the story. all intrigue about the animatronics going haywire is destroyed in such an odd way, and apparently the police just knows? is it just this one officer that happens to know? if she does, why does she just let the guard stay at a place she obviously knows is haunted, endangering not only the guard but even a kid? and if people know the place is haunted, how is william a free man still? i am fearing what this movie may turn into, and it's not the content of the movie i fear. but i fear the movie loses any sense or identity or scariness by the way some of the mysteries are already solved for you. which is absolutely not in the spirit of any fnaf related media.\n",
            "worst decision possible to bring your child\n",
            "letsss goooo spring traps in the movie\n",
            "so in the end he's gonna become freddy\n",
            "lmao this looks so legit, but a part of me is concerned that this might be real so i’m just gonna give this the benefit of the doubt and assume this is a fan creation\n",
            "i bet mike gets stuffed in a suit and is the animatronic holding the girls hand.\n",
            "its so crazy that a hate comment made over 15 games and an entire movie\n",
            "putting my money on a post credits golden freddy appearence\n",
            "i love fnaf but this looks ass. just because you get good actors doesn't make the movie good. if this is what they came up with during those years, they need to take a lot more time to work on it. the red eyes are goofy, the animatronics don't attack children so that part doesn't even make sense. those animatronics never wanted to make children \"like them\". really disappointed tbh.\n",
            "yo is that corykenshin wtf!! this movie is gonna be fire!\n",
            "nicolas cage already made this movie\n",
            "good ol’ willy’s at it again\n",
            "waiting for matpat to turn this into a 3 hour video of him dissecting a singular frame・⁠﹏⁠・\n",
            "this is going to be shit\n",
            "so here is what we got, the security guard is different guy and not michael afton's son and this movie is most likely taking place in fnaf 3. due to the fact that springtrap has been there for 30 years and the trailer shows that the 80s were the past and springt tap showed up.\n",
            "if they don't put in the living tombstone im killing myself\n",
            "so stupid lol.\n",
            "bruh the eyes are just so bad....\n",
            "markipliar better be in this movie\n",
            "the only thing im excited about is fucking coryxkenshin in the movie?!\n",
            "all i hope for them to add phone guy or something like phone guy and it’s scott coffin and if they don’t then i will be disappointed\n",
            "this looks lame lol - i'll watch willy's wonderland instead. that was at least more interesting.\n",
            "looks the same as willy's wonderland with nicolas cage.\n",
            "is this fedy??!!!11\n",
            "hopfully this movie doesn’t abandon the lore\n",

            "is it me or does the character abby look like kris from undertale\n",
            "as i suspected, the movie is gonna be shit\n",
            "not even scary\n",
            "looks terrible\n",
            "damn this is going to be scary\n",
            "if the movie is canon it means that mike schmidt is just some othe mf who got a job as a nightguard\n",
            "what rating is this movie?\n",
            "it's good but fix the fucking eyes\n",
            "holy fucking shit balls this is sick\n",
            "kinda sucks their ditching the plot of williams son being the nightguard\n",
            "looks shitty why would a cop just knock on the place and why would they hire a guard if this happens so much junk\n",
            "it's gonna be mediocre at best.\n",
            "now can we get an undertale movie??\n",
            "this movie.... is kinda shit in ym opinion, i saw many mistakes in the design. hope they are fixed.\n",

            "bro freacking coryxkenshin is in the movie\n",
            "not gonna lie, i’ve got a feeling that this is gonna be a swing and a miss, believe me, i don’t want it to be, i dunno, it just feels.. kinda forced? like they tried cramming a square peg in a round hole. the (hinted at) story seems kinda corny, but maybe that’s just more mature eyes looking at it from a new perspective then when i was a kid watching matpat break down fnaf lore way back when.\n",
            "damn a fnaf movie .. what else.. ive got high hopes for it\n",
            "if someone told me this was a fake trailer, i’d believe it\n",

            "ok, let's be real, why would he bring his kid? like, is he just dead broke and couldn't afford a sitter? also this looks creepy as frick. also, william afton in the spring bonnie suit. we all know how that ends up. (quick edit: when i was re-watching this i realized \"oh, thats not his kid, that's elizabeth.\" maybe? i don't know, it depends on if the night gaurd is michael, and in his first beginning lines he says \"hi, this is mike\" so this is mike and elizabeth. this raises the question(s) why isn't elizabeth blonde? and why isn't mike a purple, rotting, corpse?)\n",
            "it only gets upgraded that why it have 5 nights\n",
            "if i see cory get killed by an animatronic imma be\n",

            "how is springtrap in this movie?\n",
            "quick theory: the animatronics are not trying to make the girl “like them” but instead the ghost of the children are perhaps trying to protect that child from afton. anyway i know it sounds like a stupid idea, due to how aggressive they looked towards all of them in the trailer but perhaps it’s a subversion. the only reason they might be after michael is because they think he is working with afton, that’s all i’ve got for that one.\n",
            "1:29 bro, the girl sounds alot like baloon\n",

            "i’m glad the animatronics don’t look stoned anymore but at 1:33 it would in my opinion be creepier if the eyes were the sunken soulless blackness with the white dots like they were in the original fnaf game. that shit was terrifying switching cameras and seeing bonnie up in the camera with those eyes or when freddy was on stage alone and he would look at the camera.\n",
            "this is really disappointing\n",
            "where to, *gasp* why do i always get the weirdos\n",

            "personally i think it’s a good decision that they don’t follow the established lore, assuming from what they showed in this trailer. it seems they only add or tweak certain stuff to make plot for the viewers who aren’t familiar with the franchise, more cohesive and understandable on it’s own. at least that’s what i hope.\n",
            "looks like shit\n",

            "corrrrryy\n",
            "why is cory the taxi driver lol\n",
            "they basically spoiled the ending tf. at the end of the trailer when they are at the taxi you can see that the sister is not scared while golden freddy is with her. earlier in the trailer you can see the brother strap in a chair and it looks likes he is about to be turn into an animatronic. also at the end scene you can see the sister holding hands with golden freddy. this implies that the brother died then got turned into an animatronic. but hey that's just a theory, a film theory.\n",

            "damn should be interesting. blumhouse are the horror movie gurus, i was surprised to see them even pick this up at all. doesn't look particularly scary, from the trailer at least, which is a bit of a shame though. the animatronics in the first game looked significantly more...horrific? imo anyway.\n",

            "i’m glad fnaf is getting a movie but it looks like the cgi and editing is kind of from like a fourth graders first time rendering in animation it just feels off that the animatronics themselves in the movie look like the empty suits employees used at chuckie cheese’s\n",

            "my theory for the movie: so it starts off with the old man not being william. it does suck, but if you didn’t notice, springtrap was in the trailer, so it makes sense why he isn’t. so that means that william was done rotting, and it was confirmed that freddy fazbear entertainment has reached their peak in the 80’s. the children went missing already, stayed by the trailer, but how would the “owners keep holding on to the franchise?” because in fnaf 1 the company was going bankrupt as seen in the easter egg newspapers. maybe the owners were what was left of fazbear entertainment (henry, etc,) and being the company now as “fazbear freights.” also, the animictronics we’re going after mike’s daughter, apparently. this may lead to the theory of golden freddy being 2 kids, a boy and a girl. mike’s daughter could be the girl, and from the fnaf 2 mini game “give life” it showed that golden freddy still existed, so maybe during fnaf 2 golden freddy was made with the boy, but then how would the girl be stuffed into golden freddy, being part spiritual and physical and having space in the spirit of golden freddy for 2 souls? decisions, decisions… also the movie is gonna be a banger. updated! the boy could be in the physical form of golden freddy, showing how he attacks the night guards even as an illusion. and the girl could be the spirit, where in ultimate custom night shows golden freddy shaking, leading to where old man consequences told the vengeful spirit to let go of william, maybe having the girl forgiving william as well, so the rest of golden freddy won’t lash out at william as he goes. another update golden freddy has one eye showing he isn’t full yet, so that is why he was friendly to the girl, he probably wanted her to feel comfortable in her last minutes before conjoining into one entity\n",

            "hype aside, i think its going to be a fine movie. but. i don't think its going to be a good fnaf movie. i like how after so long its finally here, but just from the trailer, it leaves a lot to be desired, the animatronics just don't look scary in clear lighting, they work better when lighting is dim, and when the atmosphere is quiet. that's what they should have gone for, atmosphere over lore, i mean they even have a character dumping all that lore, and they acknowledge that the animatronics are possessed. i think what made the first (and followings) games cool and unique is that they mostly focus on the mechanics and atmosphere, and the lore is this secondary presence and i think the film should have been a reflection of that, uncovering little pieces of lore as the movie progresses. also the eye colour change just makes the animatronics look more silly, and they should have went for the \"tiny white dots in a black void\" sort of eye socket. even the title screen is a reflection of how the series went from dark and gritty to brightly coloured and saturated and i think this film will reflect that. overall. im going in with the expectation that its going to be a fun movie. but not a scary one at all.\n",

            "insane! bite of 87 should be there\n",
            "where the heck did springtrap come from\n",
            "alright so i got some wierd theorys for this movie: i may say something right so if u want to read onward it on your own choice so [maybe spoilers] -1st: in 2:07 michael afton might be punshing a ghost. im thinking that was since in production vidoes were posted online of that scene with michael punching air. so maybe the direction that movie is gonna take is micheal gets a job leaves it because the female police officer gets him to not do it but then gets hunted by the ghosts of these kids. -2nd: at the end of the trailer we see the kid with freddy and michael getting stuffed inside of an suit so the ending is he may have been killed in it, possesed it (maybe killed william afton) and run away from there with the kid whitch would raise questions like: how do the aimatronics charge and so how is freddy gonna survive outside? regardless this trailer is amazing and i cant wait for the movie :d i love you scott youve done an awesome job <#\n",

            "kids be freaking out because they are making a movie based off of a game they played a lot in their youth. that’s how the world works guys…hollywood always adapts i.p. if it has a big enough following. unfortunately for you all, this usually results in bad movies, and this looks bad. i only see people who played the games getting excited. hate to break it to you guys but it doesn’t look scary, the animatronics don’t look scary, the setting doesn’t look scary, the premise doesn’t come off as scary. i like that they cast matthew lillard in the role they did and he looks great, but this looks like willy’s wonderland and that’s not a good thing. while willy’s had a very low budget and looked like it was made for $500,000, this one looks like it has a budget of 10-20 million which isn’t very high but you can tell the different when comparing to willy’s. when this comes out, it’s going to cause a lot of drama in the freddy’s fandom as their are going to be half of people who don’t like it and the other half who is just happy to see their childhood game on the big screen.\n",

            "only bad thing is that cory was there even though mark or matpat deserved it 100x more than him\n",
            "ruined potential. while yes it is great that we are getting a fnaf movie, it is a pretty damn wrong move that they based it off only one of the games. which is why they pretty much ran out of context and made the animatronics \"want to make the girl like them\" just imagine the whole mess of a lore and details explained through this, or just seeing it through a character's eyes like micheal or sum would just be much better. but i guess that would ruin the potential of other movies to come which also means more money. -adding on to this, you can see springtrap or william in the classic bonnie suit (most likely springtrap because the suit looks damaged but could be otherewise since hes carrying a knife) just in a split second at 2:08 which most likely means it is a teaser for further movies or just like a flashback of him killing the children\n",

            "as a old school player of the series 1, 2 & 3 this does not look promising. effects and cgi are very concerning, the movie looks pretty bad and the animatronics look odd compared with the real elements. the whole story is weak for a full lenght movie, and the trailer doesn't give any horror movie feels at all. my prediction is that this is going to flop, and there will not be any sequels. i'm going to watch it thought.\n",
            "bro corey is in the movie\n",

            "overrated movie, don't understand the high score on imdb. not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. the movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. and ofcourse it wouldn't be a hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. the dropping of the bomb on japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. also the movie fail to mention that admiral chester nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against japan, wrote a petition to harry s truman personally not to use the bomb as the japanese were about to surrender anyways. however japan wanted to surrender to russia under conditions. usa wanted japan to surrender to usa unconditionally. the dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. this is a failed opportunity of nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that usa should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. the communist threat that never existed. vietnam became a moderate country, and china is more capitalist than any western nations. the soviet russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, not. russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the soviets communist era. since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.\n",

            "loved nolan's earlier work, but this is kind of lame. einstein popping out of the shadows near the end made me laugh out loud. it's a cameo orgy, nothing witty in it, no story telling inventions whatsoever anywhere in it. nolan used to do enough to give us the sense that he could -- to some degree -- reinvent the wheel. this is not the same talent as before. he's slack-assing for this government fake story nonsense job, and it's soulless work he cannot care enough about to do better than this... or it's not even nolan. that commie accuser government agent is matt perry. staged fake death, and as he's balded and put on lbs over the years, he's created this new hollywood character to be, so they staged death of perry to \"retire\" the character. a simple voice tone change, and you got a new person with countless touches carefully added to differentiate the two. same man. same shill. i dunno, the movie's ok, i wasn't bored exactly... but neither did it grip me much. maybe just prior to the detonation during trials had a bit of anticipation, but i never once cared about his wife or relationship with her, his hoes or his relationship with them, in fact, none of his relationships interested me nor were compelling. oppenheimer himself was ok as a character, he had a real conscience, was a mix of fool and genius, and sympathetic. but not very interesting or unique. the commie interrogation thing is such an absurd lie, such retarded logic i cannot even begin, and it held no tension. it's so trite honestly, how many times have we seen this kind of thing, red panic, it's tired. this felt lazy. and the critics score whatever they are told to score -- when you join media, you're joining a club, and you are a minion with zero control after that -- that's was selling out requires and is. slavery to do the evil intentions of the global corrupt facade of gangsters people call government. it's a government industry to shape the minds of the slaves of the human farm. media isn't anything more than that. it's not art, this wasn't art.\n",
            "i caught this movie today, and let me tell you, it was hands down one of the most boring films i've ever seen. it was excruciatingly long, filled with endless, inane dialogue, and completely devoid of any action. it felt like some kind of self-indulgent documentary with famous actors thrown in for good measure. i honestly don't know how i made it through to the end. it's only famous because of the memes and the inflated hype generated by americans who thought it was an action movie full of explotions. boring, boring, boring!\n",

(where we are now. remember what someone said about world war 4. paraphrased, \"i know not what weapons ww3 will be fought with.\" well, now we know. \"but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones.\" so what's the solution in an ever-escalating age of detail and agenda? mises and art laffer. chris nolan, mises and art laffer. should have countered the joker with that. instead of ignoring them. \"but if not.\" chris nolan. \"but if not.\" there but for the grace of [nothing?] go i? what an omission that was. well, we should have listened to ben stein all along, ferris bueller should have suffered the statists and remained in high school a bit longer in the 1980's. he didn't. so the best we got was star trek 7 and a false death that nobody cared for. \"bridge on the captain\" bill shatner wanted to joke. well, it's been fun. no the church and the bible are not dead, someone please tell nietzsche, the darwinian posthumanists, the socialists, and the greeks that reality is not lost. so, before the liberal documentary \"waiting for superman\" revealed the overly-inflated self-importance of our ineffective regime school systems, there was ben stein's 2007 \"expelled: no intelligence allowed\" exposing the king of the new atheists, richard dawkins. he didn't like what ben stein caught on tape. punctuated equilibrium, the excuse for lack of evidence, becomes panspermia. richard dawkins actually stated that e.t. very well could have done it. (it, being the original intelligent design of all biologies.) but at the same time he conclusively rejected another hypothesis. it was definitely *not* an eternal metaphysical designer from beyond the time-paradox of infinite regress. that's impossible. allegedly. we must have untraceable, imaginary infinite regression instead, as indicated by dawkins. or you could heed ben stein's critique - and allow it in the discourses, the politics, and the classrooms. you choose, right? how can you choose if you can't talk about it? or we can simply proclaim the doom of all that is, like marx declared pre-communist manifesto: \"everything that exists deserves to die.\" well, i would assert that is not exactly true: because eternal things exist and act with awareness - or where did ours first arise from? accident? the complexity and regular predictability of designs (both tangible and intangible) speaks otherwise - of a designed tangible and intangible within one shared universe. and such must have had an even greater designer. or it all arose by accidental chance. (does such accidental chance resemble the universe as scientists now perceive it in 2023 with all cutting edge instruments? no. the answer to such a hypothesis of things arising from non-life to life by chance is: no. so we therefore must assert that the positive reality is indeed a metaphysical one - and that the human individual is foundationally metaphysical in nature. and to the point: no, i am not a trinitarian, but i do believe the bible.) \"but if not.\" what is the historical significance of that phrase that helped avoid certain doom in the 1940's? someone should ask chris nolan, since \"everyone\" seems to think he's so brilliant at theater. war is real. nolan needs to up his games - or he is simply fighting & contending for the wrong team (that of evil and nazi-ism, to be frank - and that is not the side of the righteous among the nations). take my word for it.

            "sometimes i feel that marketing will be the death of art and historical fact on film... this film seems completely overhyped especially considering that nearly the whole story of the manhattan project is in this trailer and is a story that has been told a dozen times already and in some cases very well... with this trailer making it seem almost like a rip-off of some of those earlier endeavors to tell the story in particular with nothing seeming very knew about this attempt and therefore an almost pointless exercise if it wasn't for the immense historical weight and importance of these events. it is not missed on me that it is a nolan film and therefore likely to be at least semi decent and possibly of a scale that will look really good in imax though i'm not so sure the story itself will really benefit from imax. there isn't a lot of action pieces or a large-scale image to tell except for the test explosions themselves and of course sadly the final horrific results in hiroshima and nagasaki. the acting in the trailer seems very stiff with matt damon in particular not coming across very well here to the point of feeling miscast. it also does seem by far not enough of a cautionary tale that it should be, at least as how portrayed in this trailer. it should be about the most cautionary tale that could be told, but this really feels like american propaganda at its best. again the hype and self-aggrandizement that the trailers for this film has dripping from its every pore since the first teaser to this one does not bode well. with the film's self- titling i would imagine it is meant to be somewhat of a biographical treatise of the man oppenheimer himself but it's clear that it's really about the manhattan project more than anything else which i would say makes it predictable. heaven forbid they make a film about oppenheimer that doesn't purely focus on the manhattan project. it could be that it is actually a very good film but that the marketing department needs to be taken out back and made an example of, but we won't know until we see it and are $15 and more out-of-pocket and 3 plus hours of our time to prepare to go to see and then come back that we can never get back. nowadays i really feel like we should be able to try before we buy when it comes to hollywood films. i am not holding my breath. is it just me or does this almost feel like desperate marketing? the only thing it doesn't do is say in the classic style with an ominous booming voice,\" this summer, one man, given an impossible task that will change everything but save the world and plunge it into chaos...\" in reality we know that the manhattan project was certainly not about one man, but about tens of thousands of people and the resources of an entire country and then some along with many collateral deaths and long-term suffering aside from the actual immediate victims themselves in japan. historically speaking of course a huge slap was needed to stop the misguided leaders at the time in japan in its tracks, but i'd really like to see an epic story that told the hole unvarnished truth warts-and-all. one thing i always wondered about is why the united states didn't just explode a few of these early nuclear weapons off the coast or strictly military targets away from civilian population centers. certainly it would have been nearly as effective and bring about the end of wwii in the pacific. just something to think about. remember that pearl harbor( another gilded hollywood production almost akin to a little bit of propaganda) was largely military casualties and the pentagon and washington had had some warnings that it was to come. of course i'm looking at this with the hind side of history. anyway when it comes to telling this story again... i'll just sit here and hope that we're getting a less sugar-coated version of history here but if that's the case that's not what this trailer is saying and does not make me want to go see it. i know i may seem to have a controversial opinion especially when talking about just a movie trailer but when you're talking about something like the manhattan project and oppenheimer or anything to do with world war ii, i don't see how you can't have a controversial opinion. out of respect for everybody that died and the collateral damage that we still feel to this day literally across the planet, that the only thing to tell is the actual truth.\n",
